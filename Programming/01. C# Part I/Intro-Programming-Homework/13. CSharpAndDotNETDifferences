### Problem 13.	C# and .NET Differences
*	Describe the difference between C# and .NET Framework in 2-3 sentences.
*	Write your description in a text file called `“csharp-and-dot-net-framework.txt”`. 
    Use English.

	C# is a programming language while .NET is a software framework. A software framework 
is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed 
by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. A software framework 
is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a 
larger software platform to facilitate development of software applications, products and solutions 
.NET includes a large class library known as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language 
interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming 
languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (as contrasted to 
hardware environment), known as Common Language Runtime (CLR), an application virtual machine that 
provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. FCL and CLR together 
constitute .NET Framework.
