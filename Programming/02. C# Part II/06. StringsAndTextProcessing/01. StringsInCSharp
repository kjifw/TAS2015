A string is an object of type String whose value is text. Internally, the text is stored
as a sequential read-only collection of Char objects. There is no null-terminating character 
at the end of a C# string; therefore a C# string can contain any number of embedded null 
characters ('\0'). The Length property of a string represents the number of Char objects 
it contains, not the number of Unicode characters. To access the individual Unicode code 
points in a string, use the StringInfo object.

Compare(String, String)	-	Compares two specified String objects and returns an integer that 
							indicates their relative position in the sort order.
CompareTo(Object)		-	Compares this instance with a specified Object and indicates whether
							this instance precedes, follows, or appears in the same position in 
							the sort order as the specified Object.
IndexOf(String)			-	Reports the zero-based index of the first occurrence of the specified 
							string in this instance.
Insert					-	Returns a new string in which a specified string is inserted at a specified 
							index position in this instance. 
PadLeft(Int32, Char)	-	Returns a new string that left-aligns the characters in this string by 
							padding them on the right with a specified Unicode character, for a 
							specified total length.
PadRight(Int32, Char)	-	Returns a new string that left-aligns the characters in this string by 
							padding them with spaces on the right, for a specified total length.
Remove(Int32, Int32)	-	Returns a new string in which a specified number of characters in the 
							current instance beginning at a specified position have been deleted.
Replace(String, String)	-	Returns a new string in which all occurrences of a specified string in 
							the current instance are replaced with another specified string.
Split(Char[], 
StringSplitOptions)		-	Returns a string array that contains the substrings in this string that 
							are delimited by elements of a specified Unicode character array. A parameter 
							specifies whether to return empty array elements.
ToCharArray()			-	Copies the characters in this instance to a Unicode character array. 
ToLower()				-	Returns a copy of this string converted to lowercase.
ToUpper()				-	Returns a copy of this string converted to uppercase.
Trim()					-	Removes all leading and trailing white-space characters from the current String object.
